## 🌟 Introduction

Welcome to **AI Course**!. This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the foundations of artificial intelligence, guiding students through three core areas. It begins with **Search**, where learners explore strategies for problem-solving and decision-making in complex environments. Next comes **Reinforcement** Learning, which focuses on how agents learn to act through trial and error to maximize long-term rewards. Finally, the course delves into **Machine Learning**, where students gain an understanding of algorithms that enable systems to recognize patterns, make predictions, and adapt from data.
